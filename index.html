            <h1>Buildings as muted Witnesses</h1>
            <p>
                The story is about how the buildings are the mute witnesses of recent history. The story revolves around the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum and the different sides connected to this building. Industrial Pedagogical Technicum, which was built in 1978 by Georgian Architect Nikoloz Lasareishvili is located in Tbilisi, Marshal gelovani 4. The back building is now the home for around 65 IDP households from both the Abkhazâ€“Georgian War (1992) and the Russo-Georgian War(2008), who have divided parts of the building and created an informal living environment within.
                The article examines the building as a silent witness to Georgia's recent history, both past and present, and speculates on how this structure might evolve in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buildings are often the mute bystanders to the loud stories that are deeply connected to the social, economic, and political situations that occur around them, as well as the interpersonal experiences of single individuals living there. This assumption is exemplified by the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum. 
                So, while referring to the building itself may seem to take the focus away from the individual stories, the author truly believes that pointing to the objects might be a more efficient method to convey the stories of the people who live and interact with it.

                The Industrial Pedagogical has evolved into a home for various stories. On the one hand, 
                the architecture of the building is quite spectacular. The Technicum, located on a hillside 
                on the border of the Saburtalo and Dighomi districts, is somehow isolated from the rest of 
                the city, and the only element visible through the dense vegetation was a sculpture affixed 
                to the auditorium facade.
                On the one hand, the building was the subject of "Brutal Tours" architectural tours before 
                Zurab Tsereteli's relief sculpture was still affixed to the auditorium facade
                According to researcher Thoms Ibrahim, the architect was unknown to most local 
                architects and historians until 2017. Furthermore, despite a search in the public 
                archives, there is little information about the and there are few and inconsistent 
                drawings of the building available in there. As a result, the archival images used 
                in the article were provided by Lasha Mindiashvili, the architect Nikolaz Lasareishvili's grandson.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation at the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum 
                is particularly chaotic in this district since various parties 
                are involved in the building, yet there is a lack of communication, 
                which leads to even more confusion and uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of this uncertainty, the living conditions of IDPs are unpredictable, 
                as they do not know what will happen to the area they have been living in for decades 
                and that has almost been sold to investors several times in the past. Tenants do not 
                have the motivation to reconstruct, change, or improve their living conditions much due 
                to the specificity of the space, a lack of ownership over it, as well as their low material 
                conditions and not enough information about their future in this building.
            </p>
            <p>
                Governmental indifference leads to the further destruction of parts of the 
                technicum. According to researcher and architect Thomas Ibrahim, there would be few resources 
                required to repair the building's ceiling, which is subject to licking water from rain, 
                worsening the state of this component of the structure. Even if this part of the building has 
                no direct impact on the IDPs' shelter, Thomas believes that in the long run, if the building 
                is to stay in the cityscape, it is critical to maintain its conditions at the bare minimum.

                        <h2>Thomas Ibrahim - architect and resercher</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ibrahim in the past had multiple encounters with the building. 
                            First, he became interested in it in 2016, when he wanted to 
                            learn more about the structure and its architectural uniqueness 
                            in terms of social modernism architecture. The building was in 
                            considerably better shape at that time, and Zurab Tsereteli's 
                            relief sculpture was still affixed to the facade of the building. 
                            As Ibrahim recalls, the relief began to vanish from the facade in early 2018, 
                            and it is no longer a secret that it was stolen and sold in the local market to make some money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In December of the same year, he launched the Agora Exhibition at Industrial Technicum, 
                            which was part of the larger project INHABIT! Tbilisi, post-Soviet, 
                            is taking the lead initiative in re-examining and repurposing former public 
                            structures for contemporary use, while considering urban morphologies in the 
                            post-Soviet reality. The Agora Exhibition took place in the frames of the 
                            Tbilisi Architecture Biennial and was the first step in making the space more public and active.

                            With a manually built stairway the terrace and auditorium became publicly accessible and 
                            served as an exhibition space, a playground for the children living nearby in the IPD 
                            communities, and a workshop area. It even resulted in some graffitis on the walls, 
                            indicating that someone had been there recently, rather than decades before. According 
                            to the project, in an ideal scenario, this public area would serve the IDP community living 
                            in Technicum territory and would host activities that would further help them integrate into city life.

                            Following the Biennale, Thomas Ibrahim continued to hold different workshops in 
                            the same area of the building regarding the architecture, public space etc. However, 
                            according to him, he was kicked out by the police and was not allowed to hold educational 
                            activities in the public space. On the other hand, he claims that while the police were 
                            extremely cautious of him and his actions in the building, they were completely ignorant 
                            of the scavengers and thieves who regularly took wiring from the ground floor and parts of 
                            the Tsereteli's relief from the building's exterior.
